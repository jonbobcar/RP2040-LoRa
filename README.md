# RP2040 LoRa
 RP2040 based board with a LoRa radio

KiCad files are made with KiCad v7.

Care should be used when purchasing BMS to choose one that will auto-start. There are SKUs of this BMS that will only start if external power is provided and then removed. I have chosen AP9101CAK6-ANTRG1, which is an auto-start version.

This board is mostly tested. Files on `main` should be used with caution, you may need to do some debugging.
